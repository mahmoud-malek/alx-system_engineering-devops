## Introduction:
When a user types "google.com" in their browser and presses Enter, several steps are involved in fetching and displaying the Google homepage. Understanding these steps can provide valuable insights into the functioning of the internet and web browsers.

## How DNS Resolves the Domain Name:
The Domain Name System (DNS) plays a crucial role in translating the human-readable domain name "google.com" into an IP address that can be used by the browser to locate the server hosting the website.

## Initiating a TCP Connection:
After obtaining the IP address of the server hosting Google, the browser initiates a TCP connection to the server to establish a communication channel for transmitting data back and forth.

## Sending an HTTP Request:
Once the TCP connection is established, the browser sends an HTTP request to the server, specifying the resource it wants (in this case, the Google homepage).

## Receiving and Rendering the Webpage:
The server processes the request, generates the HTML for the Google homepage, and sends it back to the browser. The browser then renders the webpage, displaying the familiar Google search interface to the user.

## Conclusion:
Understanding the process of what happens when you type "google.com" in your browser and press Enter can deepen your knowledge of how the internet functions. This project aims to demystify these steps and make them more accessible to a wider audience.
