2. Open a terminal or command prompt on your local machine.
3. Use the SFTP command-line tool to establish a connection to the sandbox environment using the provided hostname, username, and password.
4. Once connected, navigate to the desired directory for uploading the screenshots.
5. Employ the 'put' command in SFTP to transfer the screenshots from your local machine to the sandbox environment.
6. Verify the successful transfer of screenshots by checking the sandbox directory.
7. After the transfer, proceed to push the screenshots to GitHub following the initial requirements.
8. Document the steps followed to use the SFTP command-line tool in your projectâ€™s README.md for review clarity.
