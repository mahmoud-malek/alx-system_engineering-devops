## Tasks Overview

### 0. OSI Model
- Understanding the OSI model and its organization.

### 1. Types of Network
- Differentiating LAN, WAN, and Internet networks.

### 2. MAC and IP Address
- Understanding MAC and IP addresses.

### 3. UDP and TCP
- Differentiating between UDP and TCP protocols.

### 4. TCP and UDP Ports
- Writing a Bash script to display listening ports.

### 5. Is the Host on the Network
- Writing a Bash script to ping an IP address passed as an argument.

## Execution of Scripts

All scripts should be executed on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS.

### Example Execution
