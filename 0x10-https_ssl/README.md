- [SSL termination](https://www.nginx.com/resources/glossary/ssl-termination/)
- [Bash function](https://ryanstutorials.net/bash-scripting-tutorial/bash-functions.php)

## Learning Objectives

- The second line of all your Bash scripts should be a comment explaining what is the script doing

## Tasks

### 0. World wide web

Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Letâ€™s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.

### 1. HAproxy SSL termination

"Terminating SSL on HAproxy" means that HAproxy is configured to handle encrypted traffic, unencrypt it and pass it on to its destination.

Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www..
