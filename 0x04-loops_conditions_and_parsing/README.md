# 0x04. Loops, Conditions, and Parsing

## Description

🔍 This project, developed by Sylvain Kalache, focuses on DevOps practices and scripting in Bash, emphasizing loops, conditions, and parsing techniques. The project spans from Nov 23, 2023, 5:00 AM, to Nov 24, 2023, 5:00 AM, and is subject to an auto review at the deadline. The checker was released on Nov 23, 2023, 11:00 AM.

## Background Context

This project is centered around reinforcing scripting skills in Bash, specifically understanding loops (for, while, until), conditional statements (if, else, elif, case), using comparison operators, file testing operators, and ensuring portability in script creation.

### Resources

📘 Loops sample  
📊 Variable assignment and arithmetic  
🔗 Comparison operators  
📂 File test operators  
🔧 Make your scripts portable  
📚 `man` or `help`: `env`, `cut`, `for`, `while`, `until`, `if`

### Learning Objectives

By completing this project, one should be able to explain the following concepts without external assistance:

- Creating SSH keys 🔑
- Advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` over `#!/bin/bash` 🚀
- Usage of while, until, and for loops 🔄
- Employing if, else, elif, and case condition statements ⚡
- Practical application of the cut command ✂️
- Understanding file and comparison operators and their application 📝

## Requirements

### General

🛠️ Allowed editors: `vi`, `vim`, `emacs`  
🐧 Interpretation on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS  
📝 Scripts ending with a new line  
📁 A `README.md` file at the project's root folder  
🔒 Bash script files must be executable  
🚫 Forbidden usage of `awk`  
🛡️ All Bash scripts must pass Shellcheck (version 0.7.0) without errors  
📌 First line of Bash scripts: `#!/usr/bin/env bash`  
📄 Second line as a comment explaining the script's purpose

## Tasks

📋 The project consists of multiple tasks, each involving the implementation of Bash scripts using specific loop and conditional structures. Each task has its respective file in the repository, under the directory `0x04-loops_conditions_and_parsing`.

Task list:

1. Create a SSH RSA key pair 🔑
2. For Best School loop 🎓
3. While Best School loop 🏫
4. Until Best School loop 🌟
5. If 9, say Hi! 👋
6. 4 bad luck, 8 is your chance 🍀
7. Superstitious numbers 🔢
8. Clock ⏰
9. For ls 📂
10. To file, or not to file 📄
11. FizzBuzz 🎉
